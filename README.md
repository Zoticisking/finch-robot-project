# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation


## Description of design choices
I wanted to do something simple since I didnt have a lot of time. So I chose the maze since it looked hard to add color and sound to my bird. And the maze was just to move the brid. Also on the api Mr ailleo gave me in class helped me a lot. It gave me code and methods to use.  Lastly it looked cool and interesting to complete.
## Challenges faced and solutions
Some challenges I faced where the distance of how far the bird needed to go to make the right cut/ turn. I kept trying diffrent numbers to solve the issue and it would work. it just took reputation and time. Also I had issues with my  bird move when I first ran it there was like a ten second pause then it will move. So I asked my fellow classmate Imran and he solved it for me.
## Future enhancements
Future enhancements I would like to add are probaly like color. Since I saw my classmates use color and there bird looked really cool. Also I will make the bird have sound so when I finshed the maze it makes a sound. Like a cheer or something.
